\chapter{Internship Context and Objectives}
\label{ch:2eme}
\section{Problem Statement and Motivation} %Why
Crime is a major social problem in Tunisia, threatening public safety and disrupting the economy,ranging from theft to harassment, often leaving individuals vulnerable, especially at night or in isolated spots.
 
Traditional safety solutions such as manual reporting or basic wearable alarms have served as a foundational step in personal security. However they %struggle
suffer from critical limitations: 
The binary nature of a simple button press is usually unsufficient to distinguish between 
a genuine, life-threatening emergency,a false alarm, or a low-priority situation.
Additionally, the lack of contextual awarness results in inaccurate alerts and overwhelming emergency services with false positives. %Inaccuracy and Context Deficiency:
Giving the limited resources of emergency services (police, paramedics), false alarms divert critical attention away from genuine crises, incurring unnecessary costs and potentially delaying responses to real incidents. %Resource Depletion:


%The binary nature of a simple button press: unsufficient to distinguish between 
%a genuine, life-threatening emergency,a false alarm, or a low-priority situation. This leads to an unacceptably 
%high rate of false positives.

%  This gap hits home for Hydatis, the motivation behind this work is clear: we need to move beyond simple, reactive triggers
% and build smarter, faster ways to protect people by qualifying alerts with precision.
\subsection{Market Context and Existing Solutions}

Several commercial solutions exist in the personal safety market, including panic button apps like 
bSafe, location-sharing platforms like Life360, and wearable devices such as personal alarms. However,
 these solutions typically operate independently and lack the intelligent analysis needed to 
 differentiate between genuine emergencies and false alarms and ensure fast response to threats. 
 %, leading to the limitations described above.
Therefore, there is a clear need for an intelligent safety system that can analyze multiple data 
streams—location, audio, and behavioral patterns—to provide accurate, context-aware emergency 
detection while minimizing false positives.

%In State of the Art, you can include:
%Existing products (apps, devices, services → e.g., SOS apps, smartwatches with panic buttons, crime reporting platforms).
%Research/technical approaches (papers on anomaly detection, crime prediction models, wearable safety devices).
%Limitations of these (false positives, lack of contextual awareness, poor adoption, battery issues, limited reach, etc.).

%Detailed technical comparisons
%Algorithm discussions
%Academic literature reviews
%In-depth analysis of existing methods

\section{Description}% or scope : the "What." and "how" A high-level overview of the solution.

This project involves designing an AI-powered module for a Smart wearable Solution, aimed at enhancing personal safety through automated incident detection during my Summer internship at Hydatis.
The module integrates four key data streams: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Geospatial Analysis:} geospatial data derived from Tunisian crime datasets to identify high-risk areas.
    \item \textbf{Vocal Signal Processing:}  real-time vocal analysis to detect distress signals or key words such as calls for help.
    \item \textbf{Behavioral Profiling:} behavioral patterns to flag anomalies in user activitythat may indicate danger.
    \item \textbf{Decision Engine:} later, these components are fused into a cohesive system that processes and combines 
insights from each stream, offering a foundation for reliable alert qualification.
\end{itemize}
Though, detailed implementation will be explored in later sections.




\section{Core mission and main objectives} %goals "why" and "what to achieve

My role focuses on developing an AI-powered module that fuses geospatial data, 
vocal analysis, and behavioral patterns to detect danger accurately—aiming 
for over 85\% reliability. Inspired by Hydatis’ mission to innovate 
with data intelligence, this project seeks to transform personal safety, 
offering a lifeline where traditional methods falter, and setting 
the stage for scalable solutions across Tunisia and beyond.


This project is motivated by the clear need to bridge this intelligence gap. 
The core motivation is to move beyond simple, reactive triggers and develop a 
proactive, intelligent system capable of automatically qualifying the 
severity of a situation. By harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence 
to fuse multiple data streams—including geospatial context, user behavior, 
and real-time vocal analysis—this project aims to create a more reliable, 
accurate, and ultimately more effective personal safety solution. The goal 
is to build a system that not only responds to alerts but also understands 
them, ensuring that help is dispatched efficiently and effectively when it 
gis needed most.

To develop an AI module that accurately qualifies alerts with over 85\% reliability.

\section{expected Results} % what success looks like.% en chiffres 
Expected Results: A functional AI engine delivered as a set of Python scripts, an API for 
scoring alerts, and a final performance report showing that the 85\% reliability target was met. (This is exactly what the Cahier des Charges calls "Livrables").
