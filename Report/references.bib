  abstract = 	 {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.}

abstract="Since the ``Jasmine Revolution'' at 2011, Tunisia has entered a new era of ultimate freedom of expression with a full access into social media. This has been associated with an unrestricted spread of toxic contents such as Abusive and Hate speech. Considering the psychological harm, let alone the potential hate crimes that might be caused by these toxic contents, automatic Abusive and Hate speech detection systems become a mandatory. This evokes the need for Tunisian benchmark datasets required to evaluate Abusive and Hate speech detection models. Being an underrepresented dialect, no previous Abusive or Hate speech datasets were provided for the Tunisian dialect. In this paper, we introduce the first publicly-available Tunisian Hate and Abusive speech (T-HSAB) dataset with the objective to be a benchmark dataset for automatic detection of online Tunisian toxic contents. We provide a detailed review of the data collection steps and how we design the annotation guidelines such that a reliable dataset annotation is guaranteed. This was later emphasized through the comprehensive evaluation of the annotations as the annotation agreement metrics of Cohen's Kappa (k) and Krippendorff's alpha ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha {\$}{\$}) indicated the consistency of the annotations.",

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)."
